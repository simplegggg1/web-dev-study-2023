About me

Lazy
I'm lazy in general - which means, I don't expect other people to be diligent. Minimise unnecessary tasks as much as I can.

Smart
Smart to organise and record tasks. It makes following jobs easier. Even when a problem occurred or unfinished, I leave a good trail of the progress.

Trust
Not a put-it-into-a-drawer person. When I notice an issue, actively let others know and find a solution - or remediation.

Probability
Always assume that I might have made a mistake. It makes me easy to trace a bug.
